Hi! I am a Full Stack Junior React Developer and bootcamper at the School of Code in Birmingham.

Before my time at the School of Code, I studied Mathematics at the University of Birmingham which has proved very useful in the transition to software development.

I enjoy continuous learning and I am interested in roles that reflect this. My time at the School of Code also showed me the benefits of collaboration and pair-programming and this is important for me moving forwards. I am open to learning new technologies and skills and I believe I would be an ideal candidate for any junior developer role!

<!-- **Tech Skills:** JavaScript, Ruby, Node.js, React.js, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, jQuery, SQL, RESTful APIs. -->

## Skills

### Fast learner

* The single most important skill I was taught at Makers Academy, is learning how to learn.

  For example, in our final project at Makers, we successfully built a iOS and Android compatible app using React Native, Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL - with no prior experience building mobile applications.

* In my previous career as a Commercial Photographer, I would learn new technical skills every day and apply them to live briefs. Learning by doing allowed me to work with high profile clients in the early stages of my career.

### Research skills

- Whilst building a React Native mobile app, teammates spoke of how the majority of learning came from my how I personally applied my sound research skills to help combat the team with new skills fast.

### Team Player

* My experience of coding in a team has been in an Agile environment. For example, when working in a team building a JavaScript type racer application, we would start every day by focussing on meeting our MVP, reviewing one another's code and continuously deploying new features.

### Communication

* Makers taught me key skills, such as reviewing my course mates work on Github. Feeding back and reflecting on one another's code was a really rewarding way to gain clarity on one's ability, and to understand others code.
* As a Photographer at Noble Studios, I created work for advertising and e-commerce, working alongside designers and marketing teams. We would break down User Stories, allowing us to have a clear understanding of the problem we were solving. -->
