Hi! I am a Full Stack Junior React Developer and bootcamper at the School of Code in Birmingham.

Before my time at the School of Code, I studied Mathematics at the University of Birmingham which has proved very useful in the transition to software development.

I enjoy continuous learning and I am interested in roles that reflect this. My time at the School of Code also showed me the benefits of collaboration and pair-programming and this is important for me moving forwards. I am open to learning new technologies and skills and I believe I would be an ideal candidate for any junior developer role!
